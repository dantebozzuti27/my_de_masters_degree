## 🎯 How to Use This

1. **Before each session:** Navigate to the correct week folder
2. **During the session:** Create your exercise files in `exercises/`
3. **After the session:** Update `notes.md` with learnings
4. **Weekly:** Check off items in the week's `README.md`

## 📊 Your Progress Shows Up

When you push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel:
- Your completed exercises appear in the Portfolio section

## 💡 Tips

- Add comments explaining your thinking
- Commit after EVERY session
- Your git history IS your proof of progress
