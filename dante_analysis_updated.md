# UPDATED BRUTAL ANALYSIS - 18 DAYS COMPLETE

**Date:** January 18, 2026  
**What you told me:** 18 days done (page shows 12 due to caching)  
**Current pace:** ~2.5 weeks for 18 days

---

## ✅ ACTION TAKEN: January 26, 2026

**RECOMMENDATION FOLLOWED.**
- Days 19-21: Building Project 1 (Credit Markets Pipeline)
- Projects differentiated for target companies:
  - Project 1: Credit Markets → relevant to Ramp, Brex, fintech
  - Project 2: MLB Analytics → sabermetrics, no betting association
- Curriculum updated to reflect aggressive plan

---

## THE UPDATED MATH

**You're 10.7% through a 168-day curriculum**

At current pace:
- 18 days ÷ 2.5 weeks = 7.2 days per week of effort
- 150 days remaining ÷ 7.2 days/week = 20.8 more weeks
- **You'll finish learning in LATE JUNE 2026**
- Add 2-3 months job search = **SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2026**

**NOT July 2026.**

---

## WHAT YOU'VE COMPLETED (Assuming Days 1-18)

**Days 1-12:** Python/Git basics (wasted - you knew this)  
**Days 13-14:** CLI project + review  
**Days 15-18:** Git advanced, AWS IAM, S3, Docker

**Good:** You're NOW touching cloud stuff  
**Bad:** Took 2+ weeks to get here

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM REMAINS

You're following the **168-day slow plan**, not the **96-session aggressive plan**.

### What Your Tracker Shows:
- "96 sessions" (title)
- "12/168 days complete" (progress bar)
- These don't match

### What You Need:
- Actually 96 sessions (not 168 days)
- Skip fundamentals you know
- Jump straight to building projects

---

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND

### 1. Start Project 1 (4 hours)

**Credit markets pipeline:**
- Write Python script: pull data from FRED API + SEC EDGAR
- Save to S3 with partitioning
- Add error handling
- Deploy with Docker

### 2. Skip Ahead in Your Tracker (if you insist on using it)

You're on Day 18 (Docker).

**Jump to Day 25-28: Building Project 1**

Stop doing Docker "exercises" and start building the actual credit markets pipeline.

---

## WHY 18 DAYS IS BOTH GOOD AND BAD

**Good:**
- ✅ You're executing consistently
- ✅ Disciplined daily work
- ✅ Actually writing code
- ✅ Tracking progress

**Bad:**
- ❌ Spent 12 days on Python basics you knew
- ❌ Still on 168-day plan (too slow)
- ❌ On track for Q4 2026, not Q3

---

## THE ADJUSTED TIMELINE

**If you keep current pace (168-day plan):**
- Finish learning: Late June 2026
- Apply: July-August 2026
- Land role: September-October 2026
- **6 more months at $100k = $50k opportunity cost**

**If you switch to aggressive plan NOW:**
- Skip to building projects TODAY
- Finish 3 projects: End of March
- Apply heavily: April-June
- Land role: July-August 2026
- **Only 3 more months at $100k = $25k opportunity cost**

**The difference: $25,000 and 2 months of your life.**

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

**Stop telling me to check the repo.**

**Start telling me:**
1. ✅ "I'm skipping ahead to building projects"
2. ✅ "I committed first code to Project 1"
3. ✅ "I'm working on real data pipelines, not exercises"

**THESE are the actions that matter.**

---

## FINAL WORD

You've proven you can execute (18 days in 2.5 weeks).

Now execute on the RIGHT things:
- Start building Project 1 (this weekend)
- Stop doing exercises you already know
- Focus on deployable code, not tutorials

**You're disciplined. You're consistent. You're just pointed in the wrong direction.**

**Turn 15 degrees this weekend and you'll hit the target in July.**

**Stay on current course and you'll miss by 2-3 months.**

Your choice.
